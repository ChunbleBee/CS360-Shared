balloc algorithm:
	1) get the SUPERBLOCK (== 0) information into a buffer.
	2) get the total number of Blocks from the super block struct.
	3) get the block at BBITMAP (== 3), save into a buffer.
	4) while i = 0 is less than the total number of blocks:
		A) if (i/8)th bit in buffer[i/8] is 0:
			I)   set (i/8) in buffer[i/8] to 1
`			II)  Put the block into the bitmap.
			III) Decrement total number of free blocks
			IV)  Return i + 1
	5) return 0 (no empty/suitable blocks found)
